Interface to substract ouputs from two Gaussian runs 
==============================================================
Javier Cerezo, javier.cerezo@uam.es

Description
------------
This interface is intended to be used as external job within
Gaussian, and it provides the energy, gradient and Hessian
obtained by substracting the corresponding elements from two 
Gaussian jobs.

The interface consists of one bash script (gau_Subs_gau.sh)
that manages the two Gaussian jobs and two utilities (gau2gau-in, 
gau2gau-out) called by the script to exchange data between the
main Gaussian call and the two jobs to substract.

The interface provides the substracted energies, gradients and
Hessians to be used as part of a Gaussian run, thour the external
keyword:

# external="gau_Subs_gau.sh job1_rs job2_rs"

where job1_cl and job2_cl are files containing the route section
for each job.


Installation
------------
The utilities are written in Fortran, thus a valid compiler for such 
language is needed (e.g., gfotran). 
The compilation can be performed from source/ folder using the simple
Makefile provided. Concretely typing:

 make                         - Compile the code in /source
 make install BINDIR=~/bin    - Install the binaries in ~/bin. Any other
                                path can be specified (but one MUST be 
                                given)
 make clean                   - Delete binaries


Notes about the External keyword
---------------------------------
The External program cannot be used for geometry optimizations wit Microiterations 
There is however, a more relevant issue that is probably connected to the above 
limitaion: Gasussian ignores the modredundant section (e.g., to perform a constrained 
minimization) with an External method by default. The modredundant section can be used 
adding "Opt(NoMicro)" to the route section. If any other job has conflicts with Micro-
iteraction, one can also add "Geom(NoMicro)".
